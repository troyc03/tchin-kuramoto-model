# Mathematical Modelling in the Computational Sciences: Kuramoto Synchronization Analysis
Production-grade Python implementation of the classical Kuramoto model for globally coupled phase oscillators, featuring efficient O(N) mean-field solvers, bifurcation analysis, and stochastic noise robustness. Computes critical coupling, order parameter dynamics, and phase coherence spectra.
